Title: Glider Loop #1 — Base Deposit Interaction (10 USDC)

# Glider Loop #1 — Base Deposit Interaction (10 USDC)
**Date:** 2025-10-27 20:37 KST  
**Network:** Base  
**Action:** 10 USDC deposit + menu interaction test (~10 min)  
**Status:** Successful  

### Observation
Smooth transaction on Base.  
Minor delay (~0.5s) between tab switching and state reflection.  
Gas usage remained minimal; contract seems optimized.  

### Reflection
Short interaction windows reveal the rhythm of protocol behavior.  
Even a 10-USDC deposit, executed deliberately,  
becomes a measurable signal in Glider’s on-chain data structure.
